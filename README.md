There are 2 files.
One is for hosting bus data (json_host.py)
Second one is for hosting simple map website on localhost with all neccessary data to show bus and stops locations. (bus_map.py)

both files will work as long as czynaczas.pl don't change anything related to this data...

To start files You need flask and requests.
that's all

I also provide this data world-wide on my website.

Data updates as fast as possible (every 2 - 15 seconds)
If You make request every 2 seconds nothing will change untill czynaczas.pl data will be updated.
